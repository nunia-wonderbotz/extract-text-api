What is the origin story of WonderBotz?

Our two founders, Bhavyesh and Steve, were working at one of the “Big 4” accounting firms and working on launching a robotics process automation group. They came to the realization there was great potential with this still developing technology. As they looked around their day-to-day they felt they could deliver greater value to organizations if they started their own business. And there you have it, WonderBotz has been focused on delivering that envisioned value since those formative days.
